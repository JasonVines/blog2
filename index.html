						<h2>Nerds Gone Wild</h2>
							<p>Growing up in the country I was an active person who loved doing things with my hands. I always envisioned myself doing something in the construction field or maybe metal fabrication. I didn’t have exposure throughout my life to many different careers and didn’t really think about college. Financially it just wasn’t really an option, and I’m an insanely practical person. That changed in the end of my senior year, when my math teacher talked to me about college and asked me where I was going to go to school. I wasn’t.</p>

							<p>She talked to me about my natural abilities in math and how I could put that to use in a career in accounting. Hmm… that’s interesting. I had never thought about it. I mean, I did love math and it came very easy to me. My brain just functions in equations and solutions. Plus, it appears to be able to provide a pretty lucrative pay scale as well. SOLD! Let the journey begin…</p>

							<p>Ultimately I graduated Austin Peay with my degree in Accounting and no student loan debt; even working as an intern for some time in cost accounting at a large manufacturing company in Clarksville. I was good at it, and continued on that path and continued to earn promotions and progress my career. I had a wife and daughter to provide for and my career choice fulfilled its role – it provided financially.</p> 

							<p>Year after year, working in jobs that were boring, in environments that didn’t really inspire, well… anything. At least nothing more than late nights and long work weeks that sometimes felt like they never ended, missed vacations and missed milestones in my daughter’s life, and stress so high that I had a severe case of shingles before I was 30. I thought that’s just what people did – they worked, they paid bills and they slept when they could. However, what I hadn’t really recognized was that my career choice had killed my spirit.</p>

							<p>That curious young man who was up for adventure had faded to a mostly grumpy, lifeless person who struggled to find joy in much of anything. Feelings of euphoria were fleeting and often pushed down back to the practical. About 10 years ago I had an itch, a desire to do something else. My practical inner self immediately went to work convincing me that it was a bad idea. I continued to plug along, going through the motions, growing my career financially and hating every minute of it. I was good at it, it was second nature, I was solving problems, I was offering advanced analysis that was superior to my competition, but it was unfulfilling. I secretly wished that I would just suddenly find myself in a new career that I loved. To my disappointment, there was no Fairy God Mother.</p>

							<p>Then it happened. I received confirmation that my position was being eliminated due to acquisition. I was offered opportunity to relocate, which was not something my wife and I were interested in. I was about to be unemployed within 6 months and I was the most excited I’ve ever been! Yes!! The glee felt inside of me that I would not have to do accounting for this company I’d been working for the last 15 years EVER again! Yes! No more month end closes that ALWAYS seem to be around holidays or school breaks. Yes! Wait…NO! What am I going to do now?</p>

							<p>When I broke the news to my wife, she was ecstatic. She said that I was so risk adverse and fearful of making a career change that God was kicking me off the cliff and forcing me into a situation to allow me to make that change. So at 46, I’m making a career change. I’m jumping feet first into the programming world, and although I have moments of fear, my spirit is back and I am trekking on this new adventure, eyes wide open!</p>

						<h2>In The Shadow of a Loud Mouth</h2>
							<p>Almost 24 years ago I met a beautiful brown eyed girl like no one I’d ever encountered before. We were engaged within 6 weeks of knowing each other and married within 7 months of meeting. To add to the chaos we got pregnant and had our daughter within the 1st year of marriage. Yeah, you could say meeting this girl changed my life.</p>

							<p>What drew me to her was her vibrancy for life. She was outspoken, fearless, funny and brought happiness out of me that I wasn’t sure I knew existed before meeting her. She’s a dreamer and not very practical at all. To call us opposites might be the understatement of the 90’s. 24 years later, I can tell you that sometimes the very things I fell in love with her for are the very things that drive me bat shit crazy! If you’ve been married for 5 or more years, you know exactly what I’m talking about.</p>

							<p>She’s outspoken – No seriously, like all the time. There’s not a topic she doesn’t have a strong opinion about. She’s fearless – failure is not an obstacle for her, at all! She’s funny – she can light up a room and make everyone there laugh and feel very comfortable. She could talk to a wall and make it feel like they’ve known her their whole life. She will crack sarcasm like a sniper and sometimes her humor is at your expense. She’s a dreamer – there’s not one thing in this world she wouldn’t think she could do if she put her mind to it and worked at it. All of these are wonderful qualities in a person but also can be daunting when you’re introverted and unsure of yourself.</p>

							<p>Some of my risk adversity our marriage has been that she’s a risk magnet. Even if I had a slight inkling of taking a leap, she’s come barreling through our life announcing the next JUMP she was making. It was like I dodged a bullet and as sweat dripped down my brow, I was grateful I hadn’t spoke up and shared my consideration of a leap. See, she’d just grab my hand and force us to leap together and then we’d likely been broke, sleeping in our cars, feeding our daughter ramen for months. It was the worst possible scenario for me. So, the easy choice was to retreat back in the shadows and watch her ricochet through life and create this great career in HR.</p>

							<p>What she didn’t know and I wasn’t able to recognize is that she casts a HUGE shadow (no honey, this isn’t me saying you’re fat). Someone with that big of a personality is hard to compete with for air-time. Add to it that I’m a painfully practical person and I would choose to be still in life to allow her to fly. I’ve fought my way out of the shadow and am finding my voice. I’m more outspoken, I’m more assertive and funny thing is I think she’s fallen even deeper in love with me for it. She is my rock and I am hers. Only difference is this time she’s taking a siesta in the shadow and allowing me the spotlight with her cheering me along loudly in the front row, peppered with a few heckles along the way to keep me humble.</p>

						<h2>Ninja Kicking Your Inner Nay Sayer</h2>
							<p>I’ve never been one to listen to or read all those motivational speakers. It’s not that I think they’re useless, it’s just not been something I’ve ever been drawn to. My extrovert wife is ALWAYS listening and reading those things and shares their “wisdom” with me all the time. There’s a saying that sometimes your greatest enemy is yourself; and I think that’s true.  I think back and realize that as I faced opportunities for change, I was extremely adept at talking myself out of it. I could always think of a long list of all the reasons why I shouldn’t do something. The force is strong with my inner naysayer.</p>

							<p>As I embark on this new adventure, I will have to stretch myself and I am excited about the possibilities. I am focused on what is possible, rather than why I shouldn’t do something. I won’t lie and say my naysayer is silenced, but what I can tell you is that I am growing and finding my voice to tell that little negative bastard that maybe they’re right, maybe it will be an epic failure; but I’m still going for it! Boom – ninja kick to the pie hole of that negative nelly.</p>

						<h2>Base Jumping &amp; Other Things I Never Thought I'd Do</h2>
							<p>BASE jumping is parachuting or wingsuit flying from a fixed structure or cliff. BASE actually is an acronym for building, antenna, span and earth (Wikipedia). There’s no way in hell I’ll ever do any of that, but I thought it was a great way to spark my new bucket list. See, in the last 18 months I lost 65 pounds and a career that was more detrimental to my health than the pizza I love so much. I had been heavy for so long, I never thought I’d lose the weight, but I did. I had conceded to the fact that I was just going to be one of those people to live my life doing a job I hated until the day I die, because it pays the bills.</p>

							<p>Then I stood at the edge of the cliff called Mount Unemployment. I didn’t end up there unexpectedly, and for that I’m grateful. My employer loaded me on the bus, told me the destination and then we slowly trekked up the mountain, with time to plan what excursions I wanted to take once we got to the final destination. While on the bus I’ve had a lot of time to think and plan. I’ve even made time to be frivolous – bought a brand new truck, my wife bought a new car, and we bought a new house and moved to a new town still close to family. I can tell you, that was my base jump!</p>

							<p>I never thought I’d make a career change at 46, and I never thought I’d live anywhere but Mt. Juliet. But here I am – in Murfreesboro, going to school learning and challenging myself every day. I couldn’t feel more alive!</p>

						<h2>If You Don't Know Who The Asshole In The Room Is...It's Might Be You</h2>
							<p>I’m a people watcher. I love observing people. It’s an introvert’s way of being social. For someone with social anxiety, it’s the closest you get sometimes to be a part of the group – silent participation. I avoided many social settings for my wife’s career because of my social anxiety and missed out on being there for her in times I should have been. I know many times for her, I was the asshole because of this. As I’ve fought my inner naysayer like a ninja, I have participated in every social event for my wife’s career in the last 3 years and even became more social in my own professional setting.</p>

							<p>As an observer, it’s easy to find the asshole in the room. It’s usually the loudest, most animated, one-upper in the room. That person that is more attractive than they should be and has the charisma to match. Sometimes, just sometimes you have to step back and realize that they’re not the asshole, it’s the one standing in the background, silently placing judgement on each participant, calling people fake for being polite, even to the ones they can’t stand; because it’s the right thing to do.</p> 

							<p>Ultimately, neither the over confident prick telling big fish stories or the one standing in the background trying just as hard to NOT be noticed is an asshole. We’re both just two people trying to navigate the best we can through life and use our very different coping skills. Now that I’ve stepped off the wall, I can laugh at the overblown stories of conquest these blow-hards share and I am even venturing out and sharing my own folklore, and joining in the laughter, even with strangers.</p>
